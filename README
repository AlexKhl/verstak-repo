    * builder (3.0.0)
    * childprocess (0.2.1)
    * cucumber (1.0.2)
    * diff-lcs (1.1.2)
    * ffi (1.0.9)
    * gherkin (2.4.11)
    * json (1.5.3)
    * json_pure (1.5.3)
    * rake (0.9.2)
    * rspec (2.6.0)
    * rspec-core (2.6.4)
    * rspec-expectations (2.6.0)

    * term-ansicolor (1.0.6)
    * watir-webdriver (0.3.2)

* You need to have installed drush (sudo apt-get install drush) http://drush.ws
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/drush/+bug/674269 there is a bug in Ubuntu 10.10
  you can put it with an alternate repository
  Another thing you can do is use Brian Mercer's PPA: https://launchpad.net/~brianmercer/+archive/drush
  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:brianmercer/drush
  
* You must have an Internet connection
* apache2, mysql, php
* apache mod_rewrite
* GUI
* firefox

#Desirable requirements:

* it is desirable to have installed squid to cache loaded modules with drush

  * sudo apt-get install squid3
  * add to ~/.wgetrc
    
    HTTP_PROXY=127.0.0.1:3128

    FTP_PROXY=127.0.0.1:3128
    
  wget, by which modules are loaded, download them through a caching proxy squid, speed assembly grown significantly

* phpmyadmin


#Raising the environment

  * do checkout from a repository ssh://git@github.com:AlexKhl/verstak-repo.git
  * create a database user (example: verstak) and give him the rights to all the database matches the name pattern (example: verstak_%) and the right to create databases
  * copy template.config.rb to config.rb, override necessary config parameters in it
  * configure apache2: create directory /var/www/verstak, make the directory owned by user, under which the assembly will go, give to him all rights on directory
  * settings in the config file, you need to pay attention:

      version
      : BUILD_VERSION = "VERSTAK-7.1.0"
      
      project base directory
      : BASE_DIR = "/var/www/verstak"
      
      directory with assemblies
      : BUILDS_DIR = "builds" in this case directory "/var/www/verstak/builds" must exist

      address, by which opened a list compiled builds (leave the default)
      : BUILD_BASE_URL = "http://localhost/verstak/#{BUILDS_DIR}"
      
      address, by which main page of assembly will be opened (leave the default)
      : BUILD_URL = "#{BUILD_BASE_URL}/#{BUILD_NUMBER}/#{SITE_DIR_NAME}"
      
      address of task sheduler (leave the default)
      : CRON_URL = "#{BUILD_URL}/#{SITE_DIR_NAME}/cron.php"
      
      parameters, which view for all commands of drush: -v verbose, -d debug output, -y automatically validate all actions. if exclude check mark "-v -d" console output will be minimal
      : DRUSH_COMMAND_PARAMS = "-v -d -y"
      
      Drupal version with which we are working
      : DRUSH_DRUPAL_VERSION = "drupal-7"
      
      user login of site administrator (will be created automatically)
      : DRUSH_DRUPAL_ACC_NAME ="verstak"
      
      administrator password
      : DRUSH_DRUPAL_ACC_PASS ="<PASS>"
      
      administrator e-mail
      : DRUSH_DRUPAL_ACC_MAIL ="example@mail.com"
      
      site e-mail
      : DRUSH_DRUPAL_SITE_MAIL ="example@mail.com"
      
      data base user
      : MYSQL_USER = "verstak"
      
      data base user password
      : MYSQL_PASS = "<PASS>"
      
      data bse host
      : MYSQL_HOST = "localhost"
    
#Assembly

* in the console, in the root directory of the project input "rake"
* if the environment variable is a variable BUILD_NUMBER, it is used as a build number, or takes the current date-time
